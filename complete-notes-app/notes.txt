MERN stack
create notes with title and description. we have update and delete actions
plus deployment
and rate limiting

first start by Building the API
once everything is working, we start the frontend

create backend and frotend folder
in the backend:
    build the API
        
        initilaize node.js application
            npm init -y
        install express and nodemon
                    npm install nodemon -D
                    in package.json change the script to nodemon instead of node
                    in development we'll use npm run dev which uses nodemon. put once we deploy we'll use npm run start which uses the regular ndoe command
        after i made the very basic crud components with routes and controller folders, i made another folder called src and put everything in there because its convention
            because of this, in the scripts where we run 'npm run dev' and 'npm run start' we have to update it so that is run 'nodemon src/server.js' and 'node src/server.js'
                and for consitency update the "main" in package.json as well (you dont have to but why not)


in the front end:
    react application
